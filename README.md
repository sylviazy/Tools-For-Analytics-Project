## Contents of Repository
This project is focused on the dataset of calls to 311 in the New York City. Specifically, we picked 10036 as our chosen zip code area, located in southeast New York. It's a densely and diversely populated area, consisting of both tourist attractions, such as Times Square, and residential areas. <br/> 
### Top10.ipynb
In this file, we analyze the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in NY 10036, with the total amount of incidents of each cause respectively.
### Parking.ipynb
In the second file, we want to understand whether the incident rate of illegal parking is higher in our area than the globe. To do so, we compute  the fraction of illegal parking both in 10036 and across the globe, and compare these two. The variable 'higher_parking_proportion' is True if local incident rate is higher.
