## Contents of Repository
This project is focused on the dataset of calls to 311 in the New York City. Specifically, we picked 10036 as our chosen zip code area, located in southeast New York. It's a densely and diversely populated area, consisting of both tourist attractions, such as Times Square, and residential areas. <br/>
